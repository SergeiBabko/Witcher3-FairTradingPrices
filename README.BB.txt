[size=6][b]Fair Trading Prices (Witcher 3 Mod)[/b][/size]
A configurable mod for The Witcher 3 that rebalances item trade values, allowing players to tweak how much gold they receive when selling items. It offers a more immersive, fair, or punishing economy based on your preferences - with multiple difficulty presets, optional infinite money for merchants, and full in-game configurability.

[size=5][b]Presets[/b][/size]

[list]
[*][b]Same Prices[/b] (100%)
Items are sold at full price - same as merchants pay. Perfect for testing or cheat-like fairness.
[*][b]Fair Trade[/b] (80%)
Balanced gameplay - merchants offer most of the item's value. Recommended default.
[*][b]Hard Bargain[/b] (70%)
Merchants pay less, representing tougher negotiations or market pressure.
[*][b]Desperate Deal[/b] (50%)
Merchants only pay half the item's value. Use when gold should feel more earned.
[*][b]Exploitation[/b] (40%)
Severe profit loss when selling - reflects a merchant-dominated economy.
[*][b]Fleeced Alive[/b] (30%)
You're being ripped off. Only a third of the value is returned on sale.
[*][b]Utter Robbery[/b] (20%)
Brutal setting - merchants exploit you fully. Gold is hard to come by.
